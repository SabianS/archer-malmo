			<p>When we first walked up I was exited to see what was to come. This was the first time ive been too a work envirment like this and I found it very interesting because I thought it would be more like a less busy office but it was a layed back office. The pressentation was very good and well thought out. I liked seeing the projects you've worked on. The one thing I didn't like about the presentation was the seating it was extreamly difficult to be a good noodele and not move around too much but over all I like it.</p>

I liked how you showed us how the company works with all the diffrent departments it was so cool and I even used the same layout for my economics class where I had to make my own business. Hopefully your guys layout of your company gets me a A.</p>
